Scatter plot of the expression correlation between RO60 and the pleiotropic or non-pleiotropic RNY signatures in TCGA normal tissue

# Fig7b
Graphs showing the number of variants (SNPs) identified as pleiotropic in RNYs (Â± 50 kb) and correlated (European r 2 > 0.4, left panel; r 2 > 0.8, right panel) with SLE GWAS catalog variants, and compared with the results of equivalent 1,000 random variant sets (European MAF > 0.01)

# Fig7c
Box plot showing overexpression of the pleiotropic RNY signature in plasma of women who developed sporadic breast cancer ( < 12 months after blood test) relative to matched controls who did not develop any neoplasm

# Fig7d
Box plot showing overexpression of the pleiotropic RNY signature in plasma of women carriers of pathological variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2 who developed breast cancer (< 12 months after blood test) relative to matched controls who did not develop any neoplasm
