# Fig4b
Forest plot showing the OR and 95% CI of the overlap between the pleiotropic gene set and hematopoiesis gene modules, depicted by the corresponding master regulators (Y-axis)

# Fig4c
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of the pleiotropic gene signature expression (score indicated in inset) in the bone marrow single-cell RNA sequencing profiles

# Fig4d
Violin plot showing the distribution of the pleiotropic signature expression score in each bone marrow cell type (X-axis)

# Fig4e
Venn diagram showing the overlap between mouse gene orthologs that, when mutated, cause immune system alterations (MP:0005387; "immune system phenotype") 
and the pleiotropic gene set (all cancers included)

# Fig4f
Venn diagrams showing the overlap between mouse gene orthologs linked to myeloid cell alterations (phenotypes are indicated) and the pleiotropic gene set (all cancers included)
