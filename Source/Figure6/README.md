# Fig6a
Density distribution of the pleiotropic SNPs identified nearby (± 50 kb) RNY TSSs. The 5’ and 3’ 50 kb regions are delimited by vertical dashed lines

# Fig6b
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the average expression level of each pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic RNY transcript (as depicted in the inset) across normal tissue from TCGA

# Fig6c
Scatter plot of the expression correlation between the pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic RNY signatures across normal tissue from TCGA

# Fig6d
Box plots showing of the pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic RNY signature scores across primary immune cell populations isolated from whole blood

# Fig6e
Scatter plot of the correlation (PCC and p are indicated) between the pleiotropic or non-pleiotropic RNY expression signatures and age at diagnosis of cancer, using the corresponding normal tissue TCGA data

# Fig6f
Density distribution of the PCCs between equivalent random sets of microRNAs and age at diagnosis of cancer, using the normal tissue TCGA data (n = 593)

# Fig6g
Scatter plot of the correlation (PCC and p are indicated) between the pleiotropic or non-pleiotropic RNY signatures and age at diagnosis of cancer, using primary tumor TCGA data

# Fig6h
Scatter plot of the expression correlation between the pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic RNY signatures across TCGA primary tumors

# Fig6i
Violin plot of the expression level of the pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic RNY signatures in blood plasma from cancer patients and healthy individuals, as indicated on the X-axis
