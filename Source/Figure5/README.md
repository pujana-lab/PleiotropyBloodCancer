# Fig5a
Histogram showing the relative contribution of pleiotropic variants (%; Y-axis) in RNY-containing loci (± 50 kb centered on each variant) across cancer studies (X-axis)

# Fig5b
Genomic distribution of pleiotropic variants in RNY-containing loci (red dots) and all RNY-containing loci (horizontal bars) from chromosome (chr) 1 to 22

# Fig5c
Graph showing the percentage of variants (SNPs) mapped to RNYs (± 50 kb) in 1,000 random sets of 8,155 SNPs (European MAF > 0.01 and r 2 < 0.8) and the observed percentage in the blood trait–cancer pleiotropy set (6.6%; 270/4,093)

# Fig5d
Histogram showing the distribution of identified RNA repeat elements across the pleiotropic loci
(4,093 variants; ± 50 kb)

# Fig5e
Graph showing the percentage of variants (SNPs) mapped to RNYs (± 50 kb) in 1,000 random sets of 3,847 SNPs (no filter criteria) and the observed percentage in the GWAS catalog of cancer risk variants (3.7%; 144/3,845)
